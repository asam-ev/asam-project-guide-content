== Context
If you are working with xref:compendium:How-Tos/mark_parts_as_draft.adoc[draft sections], they will not show in the preview of your writing tool by default (as intended!). +
If you want to be able to see draft sections in your preview, follow these instructions.

== Result
The preview shows the sections marked as 'draft'.

== How
[tabs]
====
Visual Studio Code::
+
--
. In the Asciidoc extension settings, go to `Preview:Attributes - Edit in settings.json`
. In the settings.json, add the `draft` attribute:
+
[source]
----
"asciidoc.preview.attributes": {
    "draft": ""
}
----
+
. Save settings.json
--
AsciidocFX::
+
--
. Go to btn:[Settings] on the right hand side of the preview
. Go to the btn:[Preview settings] tab
. Add an `Asciidoctor Attribute` by double-clicking an empty attribute line
. Add attribute `draft` with value `true`
. Save the settings (small button on the lower left of the tab!)
. Reload the preview
--
GitLab::
+
--
The preview in GitLab intentionally shows the release version of the files, meaning that the parts marked as draft are hidden. +
You can easily switch off the preview and view the source content by clicking on the `display source`-icon on top of the file window:

The icon next to it switches back to the preview.
