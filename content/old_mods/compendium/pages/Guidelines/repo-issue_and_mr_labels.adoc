This page contains a list of mandatory labels for ASAM projects.
These labels shall be applied to all projects, independent of their remote repository platform. +
Typically, a new project will come with these already set up.
If not, the project group shall ensure that they are created at the beginning of the project.

All labels apply to both issues and merge/pull requests.

NOTE: The label color and the depiction on this page do not have to correspond to the label color or form in the repository.


== Applying labels
If your project is on ASAM GitLab, see the https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/labels.html#assign-and-unassign-labels[GitLab instructions^] for assigning labels. +
If your project is on GitHub, see the https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/managing-labels#applying-a-label[GitHub instructions^] for assigning labels.


== Label overview
The following table contains links to the available general labels at ASAM, separated by platform.

{optional}

Each project may define their own labels.
The following sections contain some suggestions for project-specific labels.

If a project wants to use additional custom labels for extra filter options, each label must be documented in the project documentation and be accessible to each project member.



---

=== Sub-group labels

All ASAM projects have their individual work packages clustered into groups or categories.
These labels are defined individually for each project and should be used to categorize issues.

> An issue can have multiple Group and Work Package labels provided that it is relevant to more than one of these.


ASAM suggest the following naming schema for group/category labels:

.Suggested Sub-group label schema
[source]
----
'isSub-group':'Sub-group'
----

Rules::
* Remove spaces ("Domain Model" instead of "DomainModel")

Example::
An issue label for the group Domain Model (DomainModel) would be 'isSub-group:DomainModel'


---

== Proposal phase labels
{mandatory}

This part contains all labels specific to the Proposal phase. +
Note that these come with the template repository and typically need not be added manually.

Each issue targeting the Proposal document shall be assigned:

[cols=">1,6"]
|===
|Label|Description

|{isPhaseProposal-label}
|Denotes that this issue is relevant for the Proposal document.

|===

---


== Milestones
Milestones specify target dates and development phases for topics.
Projects organize their issues by assigning them to milestones created separately.
Each project has their own set of milestones that correspond to the milestone planning for the current project phase.

> These are actually not labels but defined separately in the milestones section of the project (under issues).

Milestones are **mandatory** for the Development phase and **recommended** for the Proposal and the Review phase.
