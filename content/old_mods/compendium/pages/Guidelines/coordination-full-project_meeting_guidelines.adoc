== Context
Full Project Meetings are meetings where the whole project meets for topics that concern the project in general. +
There are four common instances of Full Project Meetings:

* xref:getting-involved:development/phase_details-setup.adoc#_kick_off_workshop[Kick-off Workshop]
* Development Workshops
* Cycle or Development Review Meetings
* Retrospectives

The Kick-off Workshop follows slightly different rules (particularly because the Project Lead has not been elected yet at this point), so it is not covered here.
However, many aspects of these guidelines still apply there as well.


== Typical frequency
The frequency of these meetings (except for the Kick-off Workshop) is at least quarterly.
Typically, each type of meeting occurs at least every 2 months during an active development cycle.
