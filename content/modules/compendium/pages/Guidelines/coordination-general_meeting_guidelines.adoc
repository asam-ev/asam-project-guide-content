This page contains general guidelines on meetings in projects.
It is intended for meetings during the xref:getting-involved:development_phase.adoc[Development phase], but may be applied to meetings in other phases as well.


== Whom To Invite
* The target audience depends on your meeting type.
* While a project is still in the early phase, people will likely be moving around in groups
* For meetings within a group of a project, send the invite to those emails currently registered for the group
* For full project meetings, send the invite to the project's mailing list
* For all meeting types, add the following as CC (if not invited directly):
** The Project Lead and the GTM.
** The mailto:openx@asam.net[OpenX Calendar] (see xref:tooling:calendar.adoc[shared OpenX Calendar]).
** The Teams channel email; this will post the meeting in the channel for all to see. +
See xref:compendium:How-Tos/how-to-obtain_channel_email.adoc[].

> To find the list of people registered for your group, see the group's Mailing List.
Its location is described in the xref:compendium:Guidelines/coordination-teams-channel_file-structure.adoc[Teams&Sharepoint Overview].
The full project Mailing List is maintained by ASAM, the group's Mailing List is maintained by the respective WG Lead.


== Setting Up A Meeting
* If you have a Teams license, you can setup a Teams meeting directly.
See xref:compendium:How-Tos/how-to-meetings_in_teams.adoc[].
* Otherwise, feel free to use whatever solution you or your company normally use.
* If all else fails, send the details to your ASAM representative and they will assist (either Teams or Zoom).
