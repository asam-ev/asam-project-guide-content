== Introduction
A Merge or Pull Requests (MRs) are the way you merge content changes from a development or feature branch back into the xref:compendium:Guidelines/trunk_workflow.adoc#_the_trunk[trunk] or another branch.
They provide the project team the opportunity to review changes before they are applied and made public/official.


== Merge Commit Strategy
- History of commits in a MR must be https://medium.com/@catalinaturlea/clean-git-history-a-step-by-step-guide-eefc0ad8696d[clean^] prior to merge
- Commit messages to a protected or master branch must adhere to the xref:compendium:Guidelines/commit_conventions.adoc[]

ASAM repositories allow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/fast_forward_merge.html[fast-forward merges^] only (`--ff-only`) and https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/squash_and_merge.html[squash commits^] by default.
This means commits do not have to be merged manually and all commits are squashed automatically.

For squash commits with one commit, the commit message is taken directly (squash does not take place). +
For actual squashes the commit messages are taken from:

. The first multi-line commit message in the merge.
. The merge requestâ€™s title if no multi-line commit message is found.

Squash commits is enabled by default but can be turned off.
This is to make sure that in case multiple unrelated changes occurred in one branch, they can still be all added to the history.


== Dealing With Merge Conflicts
See xref:compendium:Guidelines/merge_conflicts.adoc[].


== Merge/Pull Request Review
Merge/Pull Requests are reviewed by the project team in sequential steps.
See the xref:compendium:Guidelines/trunk_workflow.adoc#_review[Trunk Workflow] page for more information on these reviews
