include::compendium:partial$_attributes.adoc[]

== Convention

====
`[red]#change-type#/[green]#group-name#/[yellow]#branch-title#`
====


== General Guidelines

. Applies to all feature branches
. All letters in the name must be lowercase
. Use hyphens ("_") instead of spaces (" ")


== Change Types
[horizontal]
`feature`:: branches that enhance the standard or add additional features
`fix`:: Bug fixes to contradictions or errors in the standard
`doc`:: Documentation changes only
`experimental`:: (advanced development) Branches where developers want to try out or demonstrate some ideas but don't expect their changes to be integrated directly


== Group Names
include::compendium:partial$group-name_examples.adoc[]


== Branch Title
. Should be descriptive and make the change clear, i.e. not "update-sensor-model-x", but rather "initial-radarsensorviewconfig-support"
. If based on an issue, the title shall use the issue-title (i.e. the issue name minus the (optional) work group prefix), applying the <<General Guidelines>>


== Examples

====
    feature/tp/lane-subtype
====
====
    feature/pp/support-for-flatbuffer
====
====
    fix/ge/index-specification-of-trace-files
