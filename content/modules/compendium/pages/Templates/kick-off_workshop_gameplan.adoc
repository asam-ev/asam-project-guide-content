== Context
//tag::context[]
The first major event in the xref:getting-involved:development_phase.adoc#_process_overview[Development phase] is the Kick-off Workshop.
Here, the project decides on its set of rules and guidelines, defines meeting intervals, elects the Project Lead and the Work Group Leads, and starts to add more detail to the project planning.
//end::context[]

== Prerequisites

. The Proposal has been accepted by the TSC
. The Proposal phase has concluded at least 4 weeks prior to the workshop
. At least three parties are enrolled for the project


== Hosting A Kick-off Workshop
include::compendium:page$Guidelines/coordination-hosting_workshops.adoc[leveloffset=+1,tag=body]

NOTE: The Kick-off Workshop typically is a face-to-face event (onsite) at the ASAM offices.


== Workshop Goals
//tag::goals[]
The goals of a Kick-off Workshop are:

. Define the project's working model, consisting of: central guidelines, rules, and typical meeting intervals
* If the project wants to deviate from the default development guidelines, it must provide a reason for doing so.
This change has to be approved by ASAM first before it may be implemented.
. Elect the Project Lead from the previously submitted candidates
. Specify the (currently) relevant Work Groups
* Work Groups may change over the course of a project.
The workshop shall define the setup with which it wants to start into the development
. Elect Work Group Leads
* The WG Leads and the Project Lead shall define their WG Leads meetings interval
. Define the Change Control Board (CCB) and its members
* The CCB shall define their CCB meetings interval
. Assign members to work groups
* Each Work Group shall define their individual WG meetings intervals
. Add detail to the project plan and milestones
. Add detail to each work package
. Schedule the first xref:getting-involved:development/cycle_planning.adoc[Cycle Planning Meeting]

The results for these goals must be documented in the meeting notes.
They shall be used later to update the content of the repository accordingly.
