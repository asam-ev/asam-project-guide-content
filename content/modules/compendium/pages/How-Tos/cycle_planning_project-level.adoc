h| TL;DR
a| * Create agenda
* Have meeting and discuss prepared goals
* Write high-level milestones and update remote repo
* Share meeting notes
|===


== Context
Each development cycle requires a set of high-level goals.
These serves as the basis for each Sub-group to then create a detail planning of their topics that relate to those high-level goals.

Typically, this planning step is done once at the beginning of each cycle.
However, a project may also do this high-level planning less frequently, setting up high-level milestones for multiple cycles ahead of time instead.


== Goals
* Define the overall goals for one or more milestones on a project level
* Give a rough estimate of required time per topic
* Estimated time required and available manpower must overlap (realistic milestones)
* The milestone shall contain reasonable progress for the project (ambitious milestones)
* Ensure all SG Leads are on the same level as the CCB and the Project Lead


== Results
* The milestones have been created or updated
* The SG Leads have all necessary project-level information to do their respective xref:compendium:How-Tos/cycle_planning_wg-level.adoc[WG-level Plannings]


== Prerequisites
The project has started and the repository has been set up.


== How
NOTE: The following is a suggestion by ASAM.
Feel free to define your own guidelines and rules for these meetings if they work better with your group members.

. Set up a meeting (follow the xref:compendium:Guidelines/coordination-general_meeting_guidelines.adoc[]) with the SG Leads and the CCB/the Project Lead
. Prepare an agenda for the meeting that covers
* One high-level goal for the project
* One or more second-level goals for the project, detailing aspects of the high-level goal
* A slot for discussing requirements and restrictions and to ask and answer questions
. Designate one participant to write the meeting notes
. Have the meeting (recommended: apply the xref:compendium:Guidelines/coordination-meeting_moderation.adoc[Meeting Moderation Guidelines])
. Update the milestones in the remote repository
+
TIP: This could be done during the meeting as well.
+
. Send the meeting notes to the participants
