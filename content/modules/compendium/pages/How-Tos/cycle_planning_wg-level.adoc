== Context
Each development cycle requires a set of low-level goals that are based on a high-level milestone.

This planning step is done once at the beginning of each cycle.
Each project may decide when and how to do them, but ASAM recommends to keep the delay between high-level planning and WG-level planning short.


== Goals
* Define target results based on the project-level milestone for the new development cycle
* Give a detailed estimate of required time per topic
* Estimated time required and available manpower must overlap (realistic targets)
* The milestone goals shall be met as closely and completely as possible (ambitious targets)
* Ensure all SG Members are on the same level


== Results
* The related milestone has been updated
* Each relevant issue has been created and/or assigned to the milestone
* Each relevant issue has an assignee


== Prerequisites
The high-level planning for this milestone has been concluded


== How
NOTE: The following is a suggestion by ASAM.
Feel free to define your own guidelines and rules for these meetings if they work better with your group members.

. Set up a meeting (follow the xref:compendium:Guidelines/coordination-general_meeting_guidelines.adoc[]) with the SG Members
. Prepare an agenda for the meeting that covers
* The project-level goals of the milestone
* Finding existing issues related to these goals and defining missing ones
* A slot for discussing requirements and restrictions and to ask and answer questions
* Estimating these issues and assigning them to SG Members
. Designate one participant to write the meeting notes
. Have the meeting (recommended: apply the xref:compendium:Guidelines/coordination-meeting_moderation.adoc[Meeting Moderation Guidelines])
. Update the issues in the remote repository accordingly
+
TIP: This could be done during the meeting as well.
+
. Send the meeting notes to the participants
