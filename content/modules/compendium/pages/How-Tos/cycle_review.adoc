TODO
// NOTE: The following is a suggestion by ASAM.
// Feel free to define your own guidelines and rules for these meetings if they work better with your group members.

// . Set up a meeting (follow the xref:compendium:Guidelines/coordination-general_meeting_guidelines.adoc[]) with the SG Members
// . Prepare an agenda for the meeting that covers
// * The project-level goals of the milestone
// * Finding existing issues related to these goals and defining missing ones
// * A slot for discussing requirements and restrictions and to ask and answer questions
// * Estimating these issues and assigning them to SG Members
// . Designate one participant to write the meeting notes
// . Have the meeting (recommended: apply the xref:compendium:Guidelines/coordination-meeting_moderation.adoc[Meeting Moderation Guidelines])
// . Update the issues in the remote repository accordingly
// +
// TIP: This could be done during the meeting as well.
// +
// . Send the meeting notes to the participants
