== Context
You have an idea and want to submit it to ASAM?
Follow the steps below.
To enter an idea, make sure to prepare all the <<Prerequisites,required submission content>> first.

== Result
The idea has been submitted to ASAM.


[#prerequisites-idea-submittal]
== Prerequisites
* The basic idea is well and precisely articulated
* The market need has been identified


== How

. Send an email with your concept, idea, question or feedback to ideation@asam.net
.. If you are not an ASAM member, you must be sponsored by an ASAM member and the idea must be send in by your sponsor instead.
See the https://www.asam.net/active-projects/ideation/how-it-works/[ASAM website^] for more details
. The ASAM Office (GTM) will contact you to clarify the details (or answer your questions)
. The GTM investigates if there are any other standards or standardization projects in that area
. Idea Giver and GTM detail the proposed idea further
. The GTM will then post the mutually agreed concept
. Interested companies world-wide can comment on the idea and xref:getting-involved:signing_up.adoc[enroll for updates on the proposed idea]

* If the proposed topic is a new standard, the next step is to organize an xref:getting-involved:ideation/developing_an_idea.adoc[Ideation Workshop].
* If the proposed topic intends to update or extend an existing standard, the Idea Giver continues to xref:getting-involved:ideation/raising_interest.adoc[gather enough participants] for the Proposal phase.
