* If necessary, update project-name subgroup members

== Context
The basis for most development projects at ASAM is GitLab.
However, some projects may choose to use GitHub instead.
The basic procedure stays the same, independent of the platform that is used. +
In order for project members and the Project Lead to work on their respective project, a new development repository has to be created.


== Result
* A new repository in the existing project subgroup has been created and the link been provided to all current project members.
* The repository name is "<project-name> <type-suffix>", where "<project-name>" is the name of the project (e.g. "OpenDRIVE") and "<type-suffix>" is the current xref:concepts:project_types.adoc[project type] (e.g. "Standard").


== Prerequisites
* The idea has been proposed and approved in the xref:getting-involved:ideation_phase.adoc#_process_overview[Ideation Phase].


== How
. If this is the first time this xref:concepts:project_types.adoc[project type] is used for this project:
.. xref:compendium:How-Tos/forking_repo.adoc[Fork] the latest version of the https://code.asam.net/common/templates/standard-template[**standard template repository**^] into the existing subgroup for the project.
* The structure of the repository is explained in the included README
.. Rename the forked project to "<project-name> <type-suffix>", where "<project-name>" is the name of the project (e.g. "OpenDRIVE") and "<type-suffix>" is the current xref:concepts:project_types.adoc[project type] (e.g. "Standard").
.. Follow the instructions in the https://code.asam.net/common/templates/standard-template/-/blob/master/README.adoc[**template repository's README**^]
.. If the project requires more than one repository, repeat step 1, but this time fork from the created central repo instead of the template
. Update the assigned members of the subgroup according to the currently enrolled members.
. Send a mail with the link to the new project to the proposal members, informing them that the repository is now ready for use.
