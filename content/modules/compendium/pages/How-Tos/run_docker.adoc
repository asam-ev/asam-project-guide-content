You can run Docker-Compose directly from within Visual Studio Code if you have added the docker extensions.
VSCode will automatically ask you if it finds a .yml file in your project workspace.
Otherwise, you can get it through the usual way of finding and installing extensions:

To run Docker-Compose on your docker-compose.yml, right-click on the file in your workspace and select `Compose Up` from the menu.
