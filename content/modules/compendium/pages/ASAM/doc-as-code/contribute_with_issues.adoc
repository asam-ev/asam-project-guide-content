//tag::body[]

== Make Discussions Accessible
{mandatory}

It must be possible for every project member to contribute to and give feedback on the content of a Proposal document directly.
For this purpose, all content discussions shall happen through issues in a project's issue board.


== Gather Topics In Issues
{mandatory}

//end::body[]
PROPOSAL::
//tag::proposal[]
Participants shall gather content for sections in issues in the proposal repository and discuss them there.

If the Proposal is for an update of an existing ASAM standard, consider collecting and using backlog issues from the previous project first.
//end::proposal[]

DEVELOPMENT::
//tag::development[]
Every topic shall have its own issue.

=== Sub-issues
//end::development[]
**DEVELOPMENT only**
//tag::development[]

{recommended}

If a topic is too complex for a single issue, sub-issues shall be created.


=== Closing Issues And Sub-issues
//end::development[]
**DEVELOPMENT only**
//tag::development[]

{mandatory}


An issue with sub-issues shall only be closed if all its sub-issues have been closed. +
If an issue has a branch, the issue shall not be closed before the branch has been merged or closed.

//end::development[]

//tag::body[]

== Issue Naming
{mandatory}

//end::body[]
PROPOSAL::
//tag::proposal[]
The name of the issue shall correspond to the respective section.

//end::proposal[]

DEVELOPMENT::
//tag::development[]
The name of the issue shall follow the xref:compendium:tools/gitlab/branch_naming_conventions.adoc[].
//end::development[]

//tag::body[]


== Use Issue Templates
{mandatory}

Issues shall be created using the provided issue templates in the repository.

TIP: Each issue template contains a description (as comments) on when to use them and what content to add where.

== Label Issues Correctly
{mandatory}

Each issue shall be labeled according to the appropriate project labeling schema.

//tag::proposal[]
For project proposals, all issues related to the proposal shall be labeled `Proposal`.

This helps with separating issues from the proposal phase later when transferring content to the standardization repository.
