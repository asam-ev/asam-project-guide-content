== Introduction

Besides xref:compendium:Projects/02_project_types.adoc[different types of projects], there are five main project phases that ASAM defines.
Not all projects must necessarily pass through all these phases.
See the phase descriptions below for more details.

|===

All projects at ASAM are required to begin with the proposal phase.
The focus of this period is to refine the technical content of a potential project with interested parties.
A project shall hold at least one proposal workshop. 
It is used to present more insight into the scope and gather further feedback and parties.

The output of the proposal phase is a set of proposal documents, detailing the project's targets, participants, the budget, timeline, and other project-related information, such as the xref:compendium:Projects/02_project_types.adoc[type of the project]. +
The proposal documents are the basis for the TSC to decide whether to approve a project.
Should a project be approved, it proceeds on to the **Development phase**.

h|Purpose
|To develop the project's deliverables.

h|Required for
|Every project type.

h|Timeline
a|**The length of the Development Phase varies from project to project.** +
However, most projects' proposed development duration lies **between 12 and 24 months**. 

image::compendium:asam/development_phase_timeline.drawio.svg[]

|===

**This is the main phase of each project.** +
If you want to learn more about how to get ready for your project, check out the **xref:tour_guide:index.adoc[]**.

During this phase, the project-type specific xref:compendium:Standards/deliverables.adoc[deliverables] are developed by the project participants.
In the beginning, the project group organizes a kickoff workshop to specify their modus operandi and set up all technical aspects of the project.
In particular, the Project Lead who is the main responsible for the project is elected.
Depending on the size of the project, other xref:compendium:Projects/01_project_terms.adoc[roles] such as subgroup leads are also elected. 
Additionally, the project group may also contract one or more Service Providers as outside help if the required budget was included in the Proposal document. +
This is followed by one or more development intervals,   specifying, writing, and reviewing content internally until the document or documents are ready for the **Review Phase**.

During development, the project group has regular project group meetings.
ASAM recommends a 2 month interval for these larger meetings. 

For more information on the types of meetings during a project's development, see xref:tour_guide:meetings.adoc[] in the Guided tour.

**Project controlling**

All projects are monitored by the TSC in its meetings.

A running project shall submit a controlling report by the deadline day for every ASAM TSC meeting.
Submission of the controlling report and any supporting material is the responsibility of the PL, supported by the OR and the project members.

Significant changes to a project require submission of supporting documents, see <<tab-significant-project-changes>>. 

Some projects may be requested to present further detail or insight during the TSC meeting.
Such a request may be submitted by the TSC, a project member or the ASAM office. 
For project members, such a request shall be submitted to the OR.
A request to present shall be submitted at the latest one calendar week prior to the deadline day.
By default, the PL is the presenter for a presentation.
If necessary and on agreement by the respective parties, a presentation may be delegated to one or more project participants.
The process for identification of a suitable slot for a presentation shall be initiated by the ASAM office. 
Any additional presentation material for a presentation should be submitted by the deadline day.

Failure to submit a controlling report by the deadline day shall result in a request to present (remotely) to the TSC. +
Failure to submit supporting material by the deadline day shall result in cancellation of the respective presentation slot and thus automatic rejection of any requests. +
Failure to present when requested shall result in a project being suspended.
Resumption of project activities is subject to TSC approval.

a|**The typical Review Phase timeline looks like this:**

image::compendium:asam/review_phase_timeline.drawio.svg[title="The Review phase timeline"]
|===


Before a standard is officially released, all deliverables have to be reviewed. These shall be complete. +

The review phase shall always consist of the following review periods.

. A project member review
. A native speaker review
. An ASAM office review

All projects, except for maintenance projects are also required to plan one of:

. A public review
. An ASAM member review

After each review period, all feedback shall be reviewed and the group shall either accept or reject it. 

Accepted feedback shall be implemented.

The project group has full authority on how and to which extent to address the reviewers' feedback.

Reviewers may not submit new use-cases, features, or requirements as part of their review feedback. +
If this is the case, then the feedback shall be rejected and transferred to the relevant issue system with state NEW.

Once the deliverables have been successfully reviewed and no issues remain open, the project continues to the **Release Phase**.

If any review points lead to a need of significant development effort, the project transitions to the development phase or decides to move the issue or feature out of scope and it is documented in the issue system.

include::compendium:partial$project_phases.adoc[tag=release]


The project group prepares a release candidate and agrees via [formal voting] to submit the candidate to the TSC for release decision. 

The Project Lead submits the following to ASAM:

* executive summary of the standard 
* complete deliverables for the standard
* all source code required to generate the deliverables for the standard including written instructions how to generate them
* a release presentation

NOTE: Download the template for a release presentation https://asamev.sharepoint.com/:p:/g/EceKQ0Ei4sJMjaWVazVfhtsB1TIxa2SAkP3D85vA_UTzcQ?e=Z29lKh[here].

Sources are those digital work products, which can be modified or edited with standard tools such as text editors, image processors or modeling tools, and which are the input used to produce the final deliverables.

IMPORTANT: The release candidate shall be submitted by the deadline date published on the https://www.asam.net/active-projects/technical-steering/[ASAM website^].
