This section contains rules that should be in other sections:

[#sec-ASM-16]
== Anchor syntax [#anchor] (ASM-16)

Every anchor consists of `[#`, the string for the anchor type, a following UUID, and `]`.

*Exceptions*

If you do not know how to use unique IDs, insert `uid` as a placeholder.
The placeholder will trigger a pipeline warning so that the technical writer can help with creating a unique ID.

*Exceptions*

If you do not know how to use unique IDs, insert `[#tag-uid]` as a placeholder.
The placeholder will trigger a pipeline warning so that the technical writer can help with creating a unique ID.

// TODO: Where to use a semantic ID and where a UUID? What are allowed characters in IDs anyway? How about a Regex for a valid ID production: [a-zA-Z0-9_-]
