* Use templates

== Use templates
* Adoc-templates are available for common types of topics.
Use them to create consistent content.
* Each template contains instructions on how to use the template and sample text that has to be replaced.
* Currently available templates:
** <<../template/generic_template.adoc, Generic>>
** <<../template/task_template.adoc, Task>>
** <<../template/uml_element_template.adoc, UML element>>
** <<../template/use_case_template.adoc, Use case>>

* Use existing foreword

[#sec-ASM-16]
== Anchor syntax [#anchor] (ASM-16)

Every anchor consists of `[#`, the string for the anchor type, a following UUID, and `]`.

*Exceptions*

If you do not know how to use unique IDs, insert `uid` as a placeholder.
The placeholder will trigger a pipeline warning so that the technical writer can help with creating a unique ID.

[#sec-ASM-78]
== Insert a unique ID in the anchors for topics, figures, tables, source code, and sections (ASM-78)

Insert a unique ID according to the following patterns:

|`[#top-<uid>]`  |topics                                |required          |-
|===

*Exceptions*

If you do not know how to use unique IDs, insert `[#tag-uid]` as a placeholder.
The placeholder will trigger a pipeline warning so that the technical writer can help with creating a unique ID.

// TODO: Where to use a semantic ID and where a UUID? What are allowed characters in IDs anyway? How about a Regex for a valid ID production: [a-zA-Z0-9_-]

[#sec-ASM-15]
== Use full style for cross references (ASM-15)

Cross references use the xref `full` style.
A cross reference consists of the text "Section", the section number follow by a comma, and the title of the target in quotation marks.
The syntax for rendering links is implemented in the https://code.asam.net/common/style-resources[ASAM Style Resources repository] in the _preamble.adoc_ file.

*Exceptions*

Use the xref `basic` style for cross references if you add cross references on figures or tables.

```
xref:fig-78b8916a-3eda-4d57-93a6-9dce838bf846[xrefstyle=basic]
```

*Example*

[.underline]#Code#
```
Statements expressed as requirements, permissions, or prohibitions according to the use of modal verbs, as defined in xref:sec-ASM-21, are normative.
```

[.underline]#Result#

Statements expressed as requirements, permissions, or prohibitions according to the use of modal verbs, as defined in Section 2.8, "Include verbal forms for expressions of provisions (ASM-21)", are normative.

. type of the document
** `BS` for basic standard
** `AS` for associated standard
** or standard specific document types, for example `junction_guidelines` or `signal_catalog`
