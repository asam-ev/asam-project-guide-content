[#sec-ASM-22]
== Use generic ASAM standard section structure (ASM-22)

The section structure of ASAM standards always follows the same pattern.

The sequence, headings and the numbering of the first and last sections are fixed.

The first section with standard specific heading and content is section 6.

The amount of annexes is also standard specific.
An annex can be either _normative_ or _non-normative_, which is noted in parentheses in the name of the annex.

The generic section structure and headings are as follows, the parentheses comment on the content:

```
Foreword (fixed content)
Introduction (standard specific content)
    Overview (standard specific content)
    Conventions and notations (standard specific content)
    Deliverables (standard specific content)
1. Scope (standard specific content)
2. Normative references (standard specific content)
3. Terms and definitions (standard specific content)
4. Abbreviations (standard specific content)
5. Backward compatibility (standard specific content)
6. (First standard specific heading and content)
Annexes (optional standard specific content)
    Annex A (normative|non-normative): (standard specific heading) (optional standard specific content)
    Annex B (normative|non-normative): (standard specific heading) (optional standard specific content)
Bibliography (standard specific content)
List of figures (content is generated automatically)
List of tables (content is generated automatically)
```

*Exceptions*

There are no exceptions.

[#sec-ASM-83]
== Use generic ASAM standard directory structure (ASM-83)

The directory structure of a repository of an ASAM standard always follows the same pattern.

The `content` folder in the repository contains the core files for the standard.

Each main section has a separate folder which contains the AsciiDoc file with the content of the main section and optional AsciiDoc files with the content of the subsections.

There are no exceptions.
