[#sec-ASM-22]
== Use generic ASAM standard chapter structure (ASM-22)

The chapter structure of ASAM standards always follows the same pattern.

The sequence, headings and the numbering of the first and last chapters are fixed.

The first chapter with standard specific heading and content is chapter 6.

The amount of annexes is also standard specific.

The generic chapter structure and headings are as follows, the brackets comment on the content:

```
Foreword (fixed content)
Introduction (standard specific content)
    Overview (standard specific content)
    Conventions and notations (fixed content)
    Deliverables (standard specific content)
1. Scope (standard specific content)
2. Normative references (standard specific content)
3. Terms and definitions (standard specific content)
4. Abbreviations (standard specific content)
5. Backward compatibility (standard specific content)
6. (First standard specific heading and content)
Annexes (optional standard specific content)
    Annex A: (standard specific heading) (optional standard specific content)
    Annex B: (standard specific heading) (optional standard specific content)
Bibliography (standard specific content)
List of figures (automatically generated content)
List of tables (automatically generated content)
```

*Exceptions*

There are no exceptions.

[#sec-ASM-83]
== Use generic ASAM standard directory structure (ASM-83)

The directory structure of a repository of an ASAM standard always follows the same pattern.

The `content` folder in the repository contains the core files for the standard.

Each main chapter has a separate folder which contains the AsciiDoc file with the content of the main chapter and optional AsciiDoc files with the content of the subchapters.


*Exceptions*

There are no exceptions.
