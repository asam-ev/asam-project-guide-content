[#sec-ASM-56]
== Illustrate complex facts with figures (ASM-56)

Figures, for example, pictures or drawings, may be used to illustrate complex facts.

*Exceptions*

There are no exceptions.

*Example*

[#sec-ASM-90]
== Use defined fonts in figures (ASM-90)

The defined fonts for use in figures are:

* normal text and labels -> sans serif font -> Calibri
* mathematical content with formulae and numbers -> optimized font -> Cambria Math
* special -> monospace font -> Consolas

*Exceptions*

There are no exceptions.

*Example*

There is no example.

ASAM specific rule.


[#sec-ASM-28]
== Make sure that all included figures are shown correctly (ASM-28)

*Exceptions*

There are no exceptions.

*Example*

There is no example.

*Source*

ASAM specific rule.

[#sec-ASM-29]
== Make sure that there are no unused figures in the repository of the standard (ASM-29)

*Exceptions*

There are no exceptions.

// TODO: (Are there any exceptions where it makes sense to keep unused images? Images are not only used in the User Guide but also the other deliverables.)

*Example*

There is no example.

*Source*

ASAM specific rule.


[#sec-ASM-92]
== Use one folder _images_ per chapter (ASM-92)

Every chapter has an _images_ folder that contains all the figures of the chapter and the sections of the chapter.

*Exceptions*

There are no exceptions.

*Example*

```
content/
├── ...
├── 07_geometry/
│   ├── images/
│   ├── 07_00_geometry.adoc
│   ├── 07_01_road_reference_line.adoc
│   ├── 07_02_straight_line.adoc
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

ASAM specific rule.


[#sec-ASM-87]
== Use AsciiDoc syntax for figures (ASM-87)

Use the AsciiDoc syntax for figures to include images, diagrams, and other graphics.

*Exceptions*

There are no exceptions.

*Example*

```
[#fig-56c849b0-a608-46a3-87be-d4d15a2d4ea3]
.This is the caption of the figure
image::scenario.png[an alternative text]
```

[#sec-ASM-12]
== Create an anchor with an UUID for every figure (ASM-12)

The figure anchor consists of `[#`, the string `fig-`, a following UUID, and `]`.

*Exceptions*

If you do not know how to use unique IDs, insert `[#tag-uid]` as a placeholder.
The placeholder will trigger a pipeline warning so that the technical writer can help with creating a unique ID.

*Example*

```
[#fig-ad5fd969-c02a-48fc-97dd-84228f630df6]
.This is the caption of the figure
image::scenario.png[an alternative text]
```

*Source*

[#sec-ASM-58]
== Create a caption for every figure (ASM-58)

Use the caption to express the essence of the figure.

*Exceptions*

There are no exceptions.

*Example*

```
[#fig-b4745bab-a439-4fda-97d2-3e79fc4c483e]
.This is the caption of the figure
image::scenario.png[an alternative text]
```

[#sec-ASM-118]
== Write an alternative text for every figure with defined size (ASM-118)

* Add an alternative text to a figure to trigger the scaling of the figure in the rendering process.

* If there is no specific alternative text available, use `img` as default.

* Figures without alternative text will not be scaled.


// TODO: What is the proper content for alternative text? Jana had a source...


*Exceptions*

There are no exceptions.


*Example*

With alternative text:
```
[#fig-fe4294ac-022d-4687-bc13-11798a9b4ce5]
.The UML notification
image::images/uml_notation.drawio.svg[UML notification, 1100]
```

With default text `img`:
```
[#fig-69e40be7-7a2a-439f-b1df-db19679675ad]
.This is the caption of the figure
image::images/uml_notation.drawio.svg[img, 1100]
```

[#sec-ASM-59]
== Write a description for each figure (ASM-59)

* The description shall be below the figure.
* The description shall start with "[Reference to figure] shows".
  The description shall not have an initial article.
* The description shall not contain references to the placement of the figure; for example, "before" or "below".

*Exceptions*

Decorative figures shall not have a description; for example, the ASAM logo.

*Example*

[.underline]#Code#

```
<<fig-7558b905-679d-4fb9-affa-3b3b72025a18>> shows the offset of the center lane away from the road reference line.
```

[.underline]#Result#

[.underline]#Figure 58# shows the offset of the center lane away from the road reference line.

* The number of the figure, "figure 58", is automatically referenced.
* The text "Figure 58" is shown as a link to the figure.
