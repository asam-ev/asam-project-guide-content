A standard may consist of multiple documents. 


Every ASAM standard shall consist of at least a specification.

[sidebar]
.Specification
--
Contains normative and informative content as described in rule https://internal.pages.asam.net/asam-editorial-guide/editorial-guide-generator/editorialguide-word/1.0.0/Editorial_guide/01_basics.html#sec-3db75534-5e38-44b7-9597-d5b4c4fdff14[ASM-22]. A Specification describes the code of operation, the structure, and the usage of the standard.
--

Most ASAM standards also include one or more of the following documents or parts. 
For more information on naming of documents/parts, see the link:https://internal.pages.asam.net/asam-editorial-guide/editorial-guide-generator/editorialguide-word/1.0.0/Editorial_guide/01_basics.html#sec-3db75534-5e38-44b7-9597-d5b4c4fdff14[ASAM Editorial Guide]

[sidebar]
.Model Reference
--
Describes all model elements and functions in the data model
--

[sidebar]
.User Guideline
--
Additional non-normative content that supplements the normative specification. Often includes usage examples and guidance on application of standard-specific features.

.Technology Reference and Mapping Reference
--
It is common practice in standardization to define technology-independent standards. 
Often these are defined as data models, particularly when intended for data formats or apis. 
These standards will generally include some technology-specific mappings for users looking to implement these standards in specific technologies. 

The advantage of this approach, is that future developments can add or remove such technology-specific mappings depending on the evolution in the industry. 
At ASAM these are called "Technology References" and are independent part of the base standard. 


A technology reference is not an implementation! See a python mapping for a function call from the XIL API below:

[source,python]
----
def _getConfiguration(self):
"""Creates an instance of the RecorderConfiguration class.
        @type
        @rtype IRecorderConfiguration
"""
    raise NotImplementedError()
----

One example, of many within ASAM, is ODS, in the past this provided a mapping of the data model for its API to CORBA. Now it is adding a mapping to HTTP/REST. This is not exclusive. 

Other examples:

ASAM SOVD:: API specified technology-independently, deliverables include a mapping to OpenAPI (yaml). See for example the capability description in section 6 on page 32 in the https://asamev-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/benjamin_engel_asam_net/EUMSBhbdtvVPowzndwoLr3oBsWMeO80zJR0bgXbqQiuFfQ?e=AhRdPc[SOVD specification] and the corresponding https://asamev-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/benjamin_engel_asam_net/EZLPcrWlwmxOotEeakYmctQBRd3XhAZvJm--8Ava8Uu4qw?e=nAMtS9[OpenAPI mapping]
ASAM XIL:: API specified in a data model, two mappings included. One to python and one to C#. See the https://asamev-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/benjamin_engel_asam_net/EnnKXmUKFVtPjkpiAQiuDBsBjWNBUOWKaMjqemWJHqxx8w?e=XRQksC[technology reference documents]
