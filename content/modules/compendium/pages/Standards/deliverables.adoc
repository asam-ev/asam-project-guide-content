A standard may consist of multiple documents. 

1..n specification (normative)

0..n rules (normative) //renamed from reference

0..n guideline (non-normative)

0..n supplementary documents (normative/non-normative)

---
Deliverables of a standard shall include at least:

Specification
Contains normative and informative content as described in rule ASM-22. 
A Specification describes the code of operation, the structure, and the usage of the standard. 
Subject to the document structure proscribed in the editorial guide.

Deliverables of a standard may include:

Data model (0..n)
(UML, or other technology independent format)

Model reference
Documents all model elements and functions in the data model, including methods, functions, exceptions, postconditions, etc.
Often automatically generated from the data model.
As of today, ASAM does not define requirements towards the structure or layout of model references.

Technology reference
A technology reference specifies the technology-dependent solution for a specific platform and/or language. Note that this is not an implementation. Such solutions often specify interfaces, such as in <<EXAMPLE BELOW>> or XSD schemas , see OTX/OSC XML.
As of today, ASAM does not define requirements towards the structure or layout of technology references. 

Mapping rules 
A document that describes the a mapping from a source, such as a generic model or a specific technology reference, to a target, which is some other technology reference. These mappings may include examples and explanatory text. 
Mapping rules are subject to the structure defined in the editorial guide <<>>

User guideline
Additional non-normative content that supplements the normative specification. 
Often includes usage examples and guidance on application of standard-specific features.
Subject to the document structure proscribed in the editorial guide.

Examples
These may be representative examples in technology-specific formats as defined by the technology reference(s). Often these are also pseudo-code, in order to demonstrate key concepts of a standard without having to dive into implementation-specifics.

Test cases
These may be unit tests to enable testing of individual units of source code in a standard.

Checker Rules


The above list is not-exhaustive, but aims to cover the majority of needs of most of ASAM's standards. 



-------
Where are "parts" or "deliverables" mentioned in standards at the moment?

Readme
- Documents the deliverables of a standard (all items)

Deliverables section
- Documents all deliverables of a standard

Foreword
- Documents all parts of the standard

Proposal: Remove the concept of "parts". Wir lassen es einfach mal sacken und sprechen n√§chste Woche nochmal.
