== Introduction
Remote Repositories provide an integrated working environment and text editor.
With these, users can directly create and edit files without having to install tools like Git or Visual Studio Code. +
The choice of remote repository depends on the project.
Most ASAM projects use https://code.asam.net/[ASAM's GitLab instance^]. +
If you are unsure which type of remote repository your project is using, ask your ASAM Office Responsible (OR).

**ASAM recommends looking up specific questions on these platforms and their features in general on their respective online documentation.**

Before you can get started, you need to create and set up an account for the project's online repository.
Select and follow the respective instructions in the tab view below.

a|== Context
The choice of DevOps platform depends on the project.
Most ASAM projects use https://code.asam.net/[ASAM's GitLab instance^].
If you are unsure which type of remote repository your project is using, ask your xref:compendium:Concepts/roles-overview.adoc[ASAM Office Responsible (OR)].

All specification-related documents are stored and updated in the project's remote (or online) repository. +
This GitLab instance is hosted and managed directly by ASAM.
The OR will create the account and the user must then set it up.

== Result
The user has activated their repository account and can access the correct project repositories.

== Prerequisites
* Account created by the ASAM office.

== How

. Follow the link in the GitLab account creation email sent by "GitLab +<code@asam.net>+" to set your password.
. Log in with your account using the image:compendium:gitlab/gitlab-standard-login-button.png[title="Standard Button"] access.
+

+
You will be prompted to upload an SSH key.
See xref:compendium:Tools/git/01_git_setup.adoc#_optional_ssh_key_pair[how to setup secure SSH connection] for instructions on generating and uploading the SSH keys.
**This is only required IF you use git locally in addition to GitLab.**


== Troubleshooting / Known Issues
=== I have not received a mail from GitLab
Ask the OR to support you by creating your GitLab account.

=== I forgot my password and cannot use the login anymore
Click btn:[Forgot your password?] and follow the instructions.

[#no-access]
=== I cannot access my project's repository
Ask the OR to grant you the correct rights according to your role in the project.

a|== Context
Sharepoint is used at ASAM to exchange and collaborate on files and documents that are not directly part of the deliverables of a standard. These are files that might not need as strict versioning or where collaboration is preferred on the basis of the Office365 platform. It also serves as the projectâ€™s internal landing page.

== Result
* You can access Sharepoint (shared folders)
* You can add and download files from Sharepoint

== Prerequisites
* You have enrolled in the project and provided your email address.

== How
The ASAM office sets up the project Sharepoint.
If this is your first ASAM project, you will receive an email invitation to join the ASAM Microsoft Organisation. 
You must accept this invitation to access project pages.
On accepting the invitation, you will receive an additional email with a link to the project's sharepoint.

== Troubleshooting / Known Issues

=== I cannot access my Sharepoint folder
Try navigating to the parent folder and then access the target folder from there again.
If this does not work: Check with your ASAM contact if your access to the folder has been revoked or the folder has been renamed.

=== My Microsoft account differs from my contact mail
Contact your ASAM Office Responsible and provide them with both your Microsoft account email and your contact email.
Make sure to mark each clearly to prevent confusion.

The ASAM office will send an invite to your Microsoft account. 
After you (or your company's IT) has accepted the invitation, ASAM will change your user email to the other one.
This will let you access Teams and Sharepoint with your Microsoft account while sending invites to your contact email.
