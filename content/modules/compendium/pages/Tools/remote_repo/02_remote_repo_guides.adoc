== Make changes in a repository
=== Git workflow

TIP: It is best practice to check for changes on remote before changing files locally and before pushing changes to remote.

The Git workflow for making changes is a 4 step process:

.Git workflow
image::compendium:git-workflow.svg[Git Workflow]

. Make the changes in your working copy.
. Add files from the working copy to the staging area (`git add`).
. Commit staged files to your local repo (`git commit`).
. Push to a remote repository (`git push`).

== Merge/pull requests
A Merge or Pull Requests (MRs) are the way you merge content changes from a development or feature branch back into the trunk or another branch.
They provide the project team the opportunity to review changes before they are applied and made public/official.


=== Merge commit strategy
- History of commits in a MR must be https://medium.com/@catalinaturlea/clean-git-history-a-step-by-step-guide-eefc0ad8696d[clean^] prior to merge

ASAM repositories allow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/fast_forward_merge.html[fast-forward merges^] only (`--ff-only`) and https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/squash_and_merge.html[squash commits^] by default.
This means commits do not have to be merged manually and all commits are squashed automatically.

For squash commits with one commit, the commit message is taken directly (squash does not take place). +
For actual squashes the commit messages are taken from:

. The first multi-line commit message in the merge.
. The merge requestâ€™s title if no multi-line commit message is found.

Squash commits is enabled by default but can be turned off.
This is to make sure that in case multiple unrelated changes occurred in one branch, they can still be all added to the history.


=== Merge/pull request review
Merge/Pull Requests are reviewed by the project team in sequential steps.

== Merge conflicts: preventing and resolving
A merge conflict occurs when multiple different changes (usually made by different users) are to be merged and some or all of the changes contradict each other.
For example, if user A deletes a section in their copy and user B adds a new paragraph to it instead, the merging tool does not know whether to keep the section and add the changes made by user B or to delete it like user A did.


=== Avoiding merge conflicts
One way of avoiding merge conflicts is to keep the TTL (time to live) of branches short.
ASAM recommends a TTL of <= 2 weeks. +
If the branch lives longer than expected, merge the parent branch (the trunk or original feature branch) into your branch once in a while.
Alternatively, you can also rebase your branch to the parent branch again.
This way you can solve the conflicts in your branch.

For more information on the differences between merging and rebasing, see https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing[Merging vs. Rebasing^].


=== Resolving merge conflicts
Once you create a merge request, your remote repository will tell you if there are merge conflicts.
It leads you through the conflicting parts and lets you choose if your new or the old content is to be merged.

Another option is to merge locally.
You can use xref:compendium:Tools/git.adoc[] or xref:compendium:Tools/vscode.adoc[] for this.
These tools also provide options to view conflicting changes and help you resolve them.

After you have removed the conflicts, you can create a new commit to your branch that includes the fixes to resolve the conflict in the Merge/Pull Request.

== Access compiled artifacts
This description only covers GitLab.
However, steps are similar at GitHub.
