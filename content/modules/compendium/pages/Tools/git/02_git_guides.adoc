== Make changes in a repository

=== Git workflow

TIP: It is best practice to check for changes on remote before changing files locally and before pushing changes to remote.

The Git workflow for making changes is a 4 step process:

.Git workflow

. Make the changes in your working copy.
. Add files from the working copy to the staging area (`git add`).
. Commit staged files to your local repo (`git commit`).
. Push to a remote repository (`git push`).

== Cloning a repository
If you want to work on a repository locally, you need to first check it out from remote (GitLab).
To do so, follow one of the cloning instructions below.

IMPORTANT: If your project contains submodules, make sure to also update them.

[tabs]
====
Terminal::
+
--
. Find the repository url on the website and copy the git url

. Open the folder on your PC where you want to save the repository

. Open the Git Bash from the Context Menu (right-click -> Select "Git Bash Here")

. Type `git clone --recurse-submodules` and then press the middle mouse button to paste the copied url.
Confirm with kbd:[Enter]
+
NOTE: With this command, you do not need to manually initialize the submodules after checkout!

TIP: Alternatively to the Git Bash, you can also use the terminal with the same commands.
Make sure to open your Powershell in your directory, though.
