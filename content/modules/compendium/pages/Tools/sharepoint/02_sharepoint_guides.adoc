This page contains guides and best-practices for <<Microsoft Teams>> and <<Sharepoint>>.

== Microsoft Teams
=== Meetings in Microsoft Teams
Virtual meetings can be created directly from MS Teams.
Meetings that are sent to a channel or created directly within that channel let everyone who has access to that channel join.
If you want to restrict the access, create a meeting outside of a channel and invite users selectively.

To do so, the user needs to know the channel mail provided by MS Teams.
