Visual Studio Code is the suggested solution for checking out repositories and files from the {gitlab}, adding and editing files, and pushing changes back to remote.
However, users may choose any compatible program(s) instead, as long as their {gitlab} stays the single point of truth for project files.

Alternatively, users may also choose to work completely within their {gitlab} by using the web IDE provided there.
