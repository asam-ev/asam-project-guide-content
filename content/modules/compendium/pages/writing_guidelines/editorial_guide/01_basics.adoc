* Consistent formatting
** Stick to *one spelling* for a word that allows several spellings (e-mail, email, E-mail).
** Stick to *one style* to present information (steps always as numbered lists).
** Stick to *one formatting* for a special purpose (first use of technical term: _italic_)

////
* Use templates

== Use templates
* Adoc-templates are available for common types of topics.
Use them to create consistent content.
* Each template contains instructions on how to use the template and sample text that has to be replaced.
* Currently available templates:
** <<../template/generic_template.adoc, Generic>>
** <<../template/task_template.adoc, Task>>
** <<../template/uml_element_template.adoc, UML element>>
** <<../template/use_case_template.adoc, Use case>>

* Use existing foreword

The generic chapter structure and headings are as follows, the brackets comment on the content:

* Foreword (fixed content)
* Introduction (standard specific content)
* Overview (standard specific content)
* Conventions and notations (fixed content)
* Deliverables (standard specific content)
1. Scope (standard specific content)
2. Normative references (standard specific content)
3. Terms and definitions (standard specific content)
4. Abbreviations (standard specific content)
5. Backward compatibility (standard specific content)
6. (First standard specific heading and content)
* Annexes (optional standard specific content)
* Annex A: (standard specific heading) (optional standard specific content)
* Annex B: (standard specific heading) (optional standard specific content)
* Bibliography (standard specific content)
