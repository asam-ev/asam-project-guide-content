:keywords: meeting, guideline

This page contains guidelines regarding all types of official meetings at ASAM. +
The guidelines apply to every project level meeting (where the whole project is invited) and all working group meetings (where the whole working group is invited).
These are considered official meetings in this context.
Clarification or co-development calls as well as similar informal types of meetings do not have to follow these guidelines.
They still may if they wish, of course.

If you are hosting an official meeting, make sure to familiarize yourself with them ahead of time.
