== Tool Overview

> **Contributing at ASAM is easy: You only need a web browser!**

All the tools that are required for participating in ASAM projects are hosted online and can be accessed through any web browser without any additional installation required. 

At a minimum, all projects use:

include::compendium:partial$list-of-tools.adoc[tag=online]

Optionally, many of these tools can also be used locally. 
Local use may offer improved ease of use or additional functionality, but requires installation on your PC. See xref:advanced_tools.adoc[] for more information.
