> **Contributing at ASAM is easy: You only need a web browser!**

All the tools that are required for participating in ASAM projects are hosted online and can be accessed through any web browser without any additional installation required. 

At a minimum, all projects use:

include::compendium:partial$list-of-tools.adoc[tag=online]

Optionally, many of these tools can also be used locally. See xref:advanced_tools.adoc[] for more information.

== Infrastructure & Pipelines for Projects

Each project requires a well-prepared infrastructure to ensure smooth collaboration.  
The following process must be completed before project kick-off.

=== Step 1: Define Infrastructure (≈ 3 months before start)
*Participants:* PL, System Admin (ASAM), OR

*Tasks:* 

- Define artefacts, deliverables, and pipeline  
- Decide on output formats  
- Identify tool and process extensions  
- Set up project e-mail list & calendar  
- Define file storage structure  

=== Step 2: Set Up & Test Infrastructure (≈ 2 months before start)
*Participants:* System Admin (ASAM) + OR

- Configure and validate the infrastructure environment
- Run test pipelines

=== Step 3: Project Process Manual (≈ 1 month before start)

*Content to be explained:*

- Project workflow
- First-time use of tooling (installation, tests)
- Ticket handling in Git
- Writing standards in Git
- File storage in Git (previously SharePoint)
- Meeting minutes as artefacts

*Delivery format:*

- User manuals for participants
- Preferably short instructional videos

=== Step 4: Inform Participants (≈ 2 weeks before start)

- Distribute credentials and manuals
- Provide contact for questions: infrastructure@asam.net
- System Admin on standby for support

=== Step 5: Project Kick-off (only when infrastructure is running)
- Agenda item: *“Commissioning of the infrastructure”*  
- Clarify open questions from onboarding material  
- Live demonstration of the pipeline (Systeam Admin must attend)  

=== Step 6: Ongoing Support
- Hotline available for questions during the project runtime infrastructure@asam.net
