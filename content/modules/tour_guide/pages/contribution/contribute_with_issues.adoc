include::tour_guide:partial$_attributes.adoc[]

You can contribute to ASAM projects directly with issues.
These issues can be created and managed in the respective Remote Repository of the project.

== Make discussions accessible

It must be possible for every project member to contribute to and give feedback on the topic of discussion directly.
For this purpose, all content discussions shall happen through issues in a project's issue board.
This also applies to discussion results from some subgroup meetings.
The output of a discussion pertaining to any topic should be documented in its respective issue.


== Gather topics in issues

[NOTE]
====
A clean issue contains the following things:

- active milestone
- assignee
- applicable labels

====

If your project is on ASAM GitLab, see the https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/managing_issues.html#create-an-issue[GitLab instructions^] for creating issues. +
If your project is on GitHub, see the https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue[GitHub instructions^] for creating issues.

Every topic shall have its own issue.

=== Linked related issue
If a topic is too complex for a single issue, linked related issues shall be created from this topic issue.
Make sure they are linked correctly.


=== Closing issues and linked related issue

An open issue with linked related issues shall only be closed if all its linked related issues have been closed. +
If an issue has a branch, the issue shall not be closed before the branch has been merged or closed.

== Use issue templates

Issues should be created using the provided issue templates in the repository.

TIP: The issue templates are provided by ASAM and are available by default in the repository.

Each issue template contains a description (as comments) on when to use them and what content to add where.

== Label issues correctly

The use of issue labels is required for filtering and sorting issues more efficiently.
Each issue and merge/pull request shall apply workflow relevant state, resolution and type labels as prescribed by the contribution workflow.

A project may also define additional labels, for example for further technical categorization of issues. If such labels are introduced, the group shall document these labels by providing an exhaustive description with the label definition.


== Discuss issues
The **content** of issues is discussed and resolved through **comments** and **replies** to previous comments.

|===
|Content |Comments |Replies

a|The issue content (body) contains the definition of the issue.

In the case of a feature, it contains the proposed content/change. +
In the case of a question or a bug, it contains the initial topic.
a|A comment to an issue is a new topic that is independent from any previous comment.
A user comments on the issue to partake in the discussion of this topic.

GitHub:: https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/quickstart#communicating[GitHub instructions for commenting^]

IMPORTANT: Before you add a new comment to an issue, make sure it is not a duplicate (i.e. the same or a similar comment already exists) and that it is not supposed to be a <<Replies, reply>>!
Failure to do so will prevent efficient project progress.

a|A reply is a comment created as a reply to a previous comment.
It creates a thread.
To continue the discussion, reply on the thread.

GitHub:: https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/quickstart#communicating[GitHub instructions for communication^]


IMPORTANT: If you want to reply to a previous comment, make sure to create a reply, not a new comment!

|===


== Close issues
An issue shall be closed once its discussion is resolved or the issue has been dismissed. +
Possible resolutions:

* The questions of the issue have been answered
* The bug has been fixed and the fixes have been reviewed and merged
* The feature has been developed, reviewed, and merged

It is best practice to close an issue immediately after one of the closing conditions has been met.

Additionally, an issue may also be closed without resolution if

* it has become obsolete and/or will not be fixed
* it is a duplicate (i.e. another issue deals with the same topic already)


== Reopen issues
If the topics addressed in a closed issue become relevant again, an issue may be reopened. The reason for reopening the ticket shall be clearly documented in the comments. If the issue was created before the current project, its state is set to NEW in the contribution workflow.
