You can contribute to ASAM projects directly with issues.
These issues can be created and managed in the respective Remote Repository of the project.

== Make discussions accessible

It must be possible for every project member to contribute to and give feedback on the content of a Proposal document directly.
For this purpose, all content discussions shall happen through issues in a project's issue board.


== Gather topics in issues

[NOTE]
====
A clean issue contains the following things:

- active milestone
- assignee
- labels

====

If your project is on ASAM GitLab, see the https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/managing_issues.html#create-an-issue[GitLab instructions^] for creating issues. +
If your project is on GitHub, see the https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue[GitHub instructions^] for creating issues.

Every topic shall have its own issue.

=== Sub-issues
If a topic is too complex for a single issue, sub-issues shall be created.


=== Closing issues and sub-issues

An issue with sub-issues shall only be closed if all its sub-issues have been closed. +
If an issue has a branch, the issue shall not be closed before the branch has been merged or closed.

== Use issue templates

Issues shall be created using the provided issue templates in the repository.

TIP: Each issue template contains a description (as comments) on when to use them and what content to add where.

== Label issues correctly

The use of issue labels is required for filtering and sorting issues more efficiently.
Each issue and merge/pull request must apply general domain labels defined by ASAM. +
A project may also have project-specific labels in addition to the official ones, specified directly in the project group.


== Discuss issues
The **content** of issues is discussed and resolved through **comments** and **replies** to previous comments.

|===
|Content |Comments |Replies

a|The issue content (body) contains the definition of the issue.

In the case of a feature or chapter description, it contains the current content of that chapter.
It shall always be up-to-date and contain the latest discussed and approved version. +
In the case of a question or a bug, it contains the initial topic.
In the latter case, the content shall only be updated to correct mistakes therein.
a|A comment to an issue is a new topic that is independent from any previous comment.

GitHub:: https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/quickstart#communicating[GitHub instructions for commenting^]

IMPORTANT: Before you add a new comment to an issue, make sure it is not a duplicate (i.e. the same or a similar comment already exists) and that it is not supposed to be a <<Replies, reply>>!
Failure to do so will prevent efficient project progress.

a|A reply is a comment created as a reply to a previous comment.
In the issue, it is a child comment to the previous one and listed in relation to it.

IMPORTANT: If you want to reply to a previous comment, make sure to create a reply, not a new comment!

|===


== Close issues
An issues shall be closed once its discussion is resolved.
Possible reasons:

* The questions of the issue have been answered
* The bug has been fixed and the fixes have been reviewed and merged
* The feature has been developed, reviewed, and merged

It is best practice to close an issue immediately after one of the closing conditions has been met.

Additionally, an issue may also be closed without resolution if

* it has become obsolete
* it is a duplicate (i.e. another issue deals with the same topic already)


== Reopen issues
Closed issues can be reopened if they have become relevant again, there have been new developments directly impacting this specific issue, or the issue has been closed by accident and has not actually been finished yet.
