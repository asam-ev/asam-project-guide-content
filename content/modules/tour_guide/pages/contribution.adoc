[cols="<.<1,<.<3a"]

|To transition to next state
|*Actions*

* Categorize the issue (i.e. assign the issue type)
** If the issue has been raised previously or was solved in another issue, assign {resolutionTypeDuplicate-label} and close the issue
** Otherwise, assign the correct type.

== Classified

[cols="<.<1,<.<3a"]
|===

|What
|An issue that has a type and that needs to be accepted by the group.

|Who
|Relevant lead (project lead or subgroup lead)

|State label

|Transitions

Issue is a duplicate::-> CLOSED ({resolutionTypeDuplicate-label}) +
Issue is rejected::-> CLOSED ({resolutionTypeRejected-label}) +
Issue is accepted::-> ACCEPTED 

|===

[cols="<.<1,<.<3a"]
|===

|To transition to next state
|*Actions*

* Decide whether to address the issue or not
* If the issue is accepted, it is assigned to a release milestone
* If rejected, {resolutionTypeRejected-label} is assigned
* If duplicate, {resolutionTypeDuplicate-label} is assigned
* If accepted, a release milestone is assigned

|===




== Accepted


[cols="<.<1,<.<3a"]
|===

|What
|An issue that has been accepted by the project group, which needs to be assigned to a responsible, given a due date and needs a clear specification of requirements to be fulfilled.

|Who
|Relevant lead (Project Lead or Subgroup Lead)

|State Label

[cols="<.<1,<.<3a"]
|===

|To transition to next state
|*Actions*

* Assign the issue to a project participant -> the solution responsible
* Define a solution team within the issue description. This may be either of:
** a project subgroup - assign the respective label of the subgroup to the issue.
** an unstructured group of project participants, specific to this issue - the names of these participants shall be documented in the issue description. 
* Check if the issue needs to be split into multiple sub-issues or tasks (making it a parent issue)
** If it needs to be split, each sub-issue enters state ACCEPTED immediately
** Each sub-issue applies the remaining workflow individually
** A parent issue may only be closed if all its sub-issues have been closed
* Set a <<Due dates,due date>> for the solution (should not exceed 4 weeks of development)
* Clear specification of requirements to be fulfilled by a solution

|===


== In Progress


[cols="<.<1,<.<3a"]
|===

|What
|An issue that is assigned a responsible, has a due date and clear requirements, which now needs to be implemented in a solution.

[cols="<.<1,<.<3a"]
|===

|To transition to next state
|*Actions*

* Develop a solution together with relevant group (solution team, see xref:tour_guide:contribution/issue_implementation.adoc[])
* Document the solution by creating a merge/pull request. Some projects do not yet use the DevOps platforms of ASAM. In this case the solution location is to be agreed on by the project on start.
* Coordinate, monitor and discuss developments within solution team
* On solution completion, set a due date for review (should not exceed 2 weeks)
* Inform project lead and any relevant subgroups of issue review

== Implemented::


[cols="<.<1,<.<3a"]

|What
|An issue that has a solution in an associated merge request or document, which is ready to be reviewed by the group.

[cols="<.<1,<.<3a"]
|===

|To transition to next state
|*Actions*

* Perform solution review
** Project group or delegated subgroup reviews solution and documents their feedback:
*** General feedback: as comment on Merge/Pull Request
*** Specific feedback: as review in changes tab
*** If the solution is documented otherwise, the use of comments in the document is recommended
** Identified minor corrections are implemented directly in collaboration between reviewers and solution responsible
* Discuss review results in project group meeting
* Accept or reject solution and document decision in issue
** Identified major corrections lead to rejection of solution
** If accepted, appoint and assign solution to an xref:compendium:Projects/01_project_terms.adoc#integrator[Integrator] (responsible for integrating the solution)
