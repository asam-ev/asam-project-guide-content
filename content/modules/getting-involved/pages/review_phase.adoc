The Office publishes the start of the public review process via newsletter and https://www.asam.net/active-projects/public-review/[ASAM website], and provides additional information, such as a brief description of the changes in the standard, review process steps and the review deadline.

The Office provides an IT-solution for carrying out the public draft review.
The Office provides technical support for reviewers and ensures that review feedback is accessible to the project group members in a timely manner.

In general, every ASAM member can download the draft standard and participate in the review.
The Office may restrict the group of reviewers in agreement with the project group members or as per TSC decision.

Members of the project group are available to answer technical questions from reviewers.

Reviewers shall not submit new use-cases, features or requirements as part of their review feedback.
The Office asks the reviewers to submit such requests via the regular ASAM CR system.

The minimum review period for a new standard is 8 weeks and shall not exceed 16 weeks.
The minimum review period for a major version is 6 weeks and shall not exceed 12 weeks.

The ASAM office publishes the draft and provides an IT environment in which members can provide their comments.

The project group members have the obligation to review each comment and make a decision.
The project group has full authority to decide, how to handle a comment, e.g. to accept, modify, defer or reject comments, and to make corresponding changes to the standard at their own discretion.
