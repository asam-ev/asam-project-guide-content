== Process overview
New projects do not start themselves.
They get initiated by someone entering an idea for a new project. +
The Ideation phase specifies the process of how an idea for a new topic can be entered and is then analyzed at ASAM.
For more information, see the https://www.asam.net/active-projects/ideation/how-it-works/[**info page**^] on the ASAM website.

== Ideation phase steps
The Ideation phase consists of the following steps, which are explained in detail in their own sections:

* <<Entering an idea>>
* OPTIONAL: <<Ideation Workshop>>
* <<Gathering participants>>

=== Entering an idea
[cols="1h,20"]
|===
|Purpose
|To trigger the ideation process.

|Responsible
|{role-standard-user} -> {role-idea-giver}
|===

The ideation phase starts with the person with the idea (the Idea Giver) or their ASAM sponsor sending in the idea. +
See xref:ideation/enter_new_idea.adoc[].

=== Ideation Workshop
[cols="1h,20"]
|===
|Purpose
a|* To discuss the idea, detail it further, and decide whether to proceed to the Proposal phase.
* OPTIONAL: To determine the initial Proposal participants (must be or become "active" ASAM member)

|Responsible
|{role-gtm}, in collaboration with initiating member(s) ({role-idea-giver}).

|Involved
|{role-member} and {role-standard-user}, particularly technical domain experts, internal end-user support experts, product managers, development managers
|===

The Office is responsible for the preparation and carrying out of the Ideation Workshop.
This is done in close cooperation with the member(s), who initiated the process and are the major drivers of the idea.

Ideation Workshops are open to all ASAM members.
Non-members can participate upon invitation by the Office. +
By default, the Office moderates the workshop.
This task can be passed to a member, if appropriate.

If there is significant interest in the proposed project in different regions (primarily in North America, Europe, East Asia), then the Office organizes meetings in a way that equally allows all members from those regions to influence the results of the Ideation Workshop.


=== Gathering participants
[cols="1h,20"]
|===
|Purpose
|To meet the requirements for transitioning to the Proposal phase.

|Responsible
|{role-idea-giver}

|Involved
|{role-gtm}, {role-standard-user}
|===

The Idea Giver finds enough participants and at least one writer for the Proposal phase and communicates the list to the ASAM Office.
