== Context
At the start of each development cycle, the project must define the cycle's goals.
These are fixed in a corresponding milestone. +
The planning has two steps:

. The <<Project-level Planning,high-level planning>> for the project
. The <<Work-group-level Planning,low-level planning>> per work group, based on the high-level planning

Since the latter depend on the former, the <<Project-level Planning>> must occur first.
