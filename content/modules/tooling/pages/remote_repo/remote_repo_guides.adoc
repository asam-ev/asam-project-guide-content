== General Workflows
include::compendium:page$Guidelines/workflow__trunk.adoc[leveloffset=+2, tag=!compendium]

---

=== Contributing Through Issues
You can contribute to ASAM projects directly through issues.
These issues can be created and managed in the respective Remote Repository of the project.

For more information, see xref:compendium:page$Guidelines/workflow__contribute_with_issues.adoc[] in the Compendium.

---


=== Ticket Triage
Projects may get so big, that issues are created and forgotten without ever being finished.
To prevent unnecessary and obsolete issues bogging up the repository, ASAM employs a Ticket Triage workflow.

For more information, see xref:compendium:page$Guidelines/workflow__ticket_triage.adoc[] in the Compendium.
