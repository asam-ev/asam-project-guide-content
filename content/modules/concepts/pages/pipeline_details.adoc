== Process Automation
ASAM projects typically automate the following steps:

* Convert AsciiDoc files to html and pdf using https://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor^]
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)[Linting^] and testing documents for rules defined in the xref:compendium:writing_guidelines/editorial_guide.adoc[] and returning found errors
* Publishing results as pipeline artifacts for downloads or distribution
* Running project-specific scripts for additional features, such as converting uml diagrams to AsciiDoc files
