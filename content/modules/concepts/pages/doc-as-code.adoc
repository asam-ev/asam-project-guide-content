:description: Gives an introduction for the concept of documentation-as-code.

== Introduction
Many newer projects at ASAM follow the concept of Documentation as Code (Doc-as-Code). +
This concept refers to using the same tools and methods for documentation (or standardization) as for writing (software) code.
The main benefit of this concept is the separation of content and text in documents from its layout rules and publishing.

[IMPORTANT]
====
NOT to be confused with the Dog-as-Code concept!!!

== Concept
As described in the introduction, the general concept is to use established tools and processes from software development and apply them in the creation of documents.
At ASAM, the main aspects of this concept are:

* Writing documents in <<sec-plain-text-markup,plain text markup>>
* Using <<sec-versioning-repo,repositories with version control systems>>
* Collaborating on projects through <<sec-online-collaboration,online repository platforms>>

[#sec-plain-text-markup]
=== Plain Text Content Files

At ASAM, the central aspect of this concept is the usage of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_text[plain text^] documents with a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language[semantic markup language^] in creating standards and other documents, particularly the free https://asciidoc-py.github.io/index.html[AsciiDoc format^].
Its main benefit is the separation of content from style and layout rules, making it possible to specify general layout settings in a separate set of files and instructions for consistency over multiple projects.
Writers also get the benefit of being able to focus on content first, handing of the layouting to other people.

Another benefit is that AsciiDoc files can be opened and edited with any type of text editor, making it a platform-agnostic format.
Different people can write content independent of the operating system on their work devices or requiring specific software licenses.

Finally, the content is decoupled from the target output, making it easy to generate different types of documentation from the same source files, such as single-file PDFs as well as multi-page online documentation in html.
It is even possible to generate multiple types of output in the same process.

Specific ASAM writing styles and rules can be found in the xref:compendium:Guidelines/editorial_guide.adoc[**Editorial Guide**].


[#sec-versioning-repo]
=== Versioning And Repositories
Besides the separation of source text and publication files, using tool-supported document versioning is another main aspect in the Doc-as-Code.
ASAM projects employing Doc-as-Code use the software https://git-scm.com/[Git^] for this purpose. +
It allows for working on different parts, features, or versions of a project separately whilst also providing the necessary features for merging all changes that were made on these different versions again later.
As this works best with plain text documents, it goes extremely well together with the plain text markup approach to document writing explained above.

Content is stored in so-called repositories that each consist of one or more branches.
At ASAM, there usually is one main branch (called "main" or (outdated) "master") and possibly one or more feature branches.
The central branch (also called the "trunk") acts as the agreed or released "official" state of the repository, whereas the feature branches contain the current development topics. +
Each feature branch targets a single aspect of development, for example the language specification.
Once the development in a feature branch has advanced enough, it's changes are merged back into the trunk.
This is done through a so-called Merge Request (MR), sometimes called a Pull Request (PR) instead.

image::example-repo-workflow.drawio.svg[title=Repository workflow and branching example.]

NOTE: The strategy of having one main branch (trunk) and develop changes in separate branches is called trunk-based development and the quasi-standard of modern software development.

These repositories also contain some files with information about the history and current state of the content.
The repository information is updated and used by Git and usually needs not to be changed by users manually.

TIP: If you want to learn more about Git itself, ASAM recommends online introductions and tutorials such as https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/[**this one**^].
Additionally, you can find more information on using Git and working with repositories at ASAM in the xref:tooling:git.adoc[tooling section].


[#sec-online-collaboration]
=== Online Collaboration
The work on standards, particularly at ASAM, is of collaborative nature:
People from different companies companies join in a project to develope something together.
The idea is to create something that will be adapted and used not just by a single company but a majority of the target industry. +
Online repository platforms like GitLab and GitHub support the collaboration by providing features for commenting and reviewing content changes as well as issue boards for creating and tracking topics.
In addition to that, they also integrate the same versioning and repository aspects described in the <<sec-versioning-repo,section above>>.

Using online collabartion platforms with repository support provide multiple benefits:

* They typically provide online editors for content, so users can choose to participate in projects xref:tooling:working-without-software-installation.adoc[without having to install software] (besides any standard web browser)
* Merge Requests (Pull Requests) can be reviewed and commented on with a side-by-side preview in the browser (diff view)
* They act as central repository location for the project(s) that can be accessed from anywhere (provided the user has sufficient rights), so all involved people always have access to the latest submitted changes
* They enable central automation steps through xref:pipeline_details.adoc[CI/CD pipelines], for example automated writing rules checks on a document after it was updated
* Integrated issue boards for keeping track of tasks, found problems, discussion topics, etc.

The <<fig-issue_example-gitlab,figure below>> shows an example issue from a project where a topic discussion takes place.

ASAM currently supports projects on both its internal GitLab instance as well as on the public GitHub.
Each project can decide independently which platform it will use.
GitLab is the most commonly used platform right now at ASAM.
