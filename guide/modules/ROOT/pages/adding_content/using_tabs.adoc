NOTE: This is built on https://gitlab.com/antora/antora-asciidoctor-extensions/-/tree/main/tabs-block[window=_blank].

To organize content on a page more compactly, you can use tabs.

== How to use

=== Source code

[source]
----
[tabs]
====
Tab 1::
+
--
Some text here.
--
Tab 2::
+
--
Another text there.
--
====
----

=== Result

[tabs]
====
Tab 1::
+
--
Some text here.
--
Tab 2::
+
--
Another text there.
--
====

== Limitations
* This implementation uses open blocks ("--").
You cannot nest open blocks within open blocks!
* You cannot directly define sections within tabs.
However, you can use a table with the explicit asciidoctor command (a|) to include content with full asciidoctor substitutions
* You cannot reference sections in tabs directly and the table-of-content will not list any sections in tabs
