:description: Collects all pages on including or referencing content in Antora.

include::partial$_attributes.adoc[]




The following pages describe how to add or change content in files.

NOTE: Content that is linked to or included from somewhere else is described in xref:ref-include.adoc[].

TIP: You can exclude a page from Antora through its name.
If the filename starts with a dot ("."), Antora ignores it. +
If the filename starts with an underscore ("_"), Antora does not publish it but adds it to its internal content catalog (i.e. it is aware of it).
