//tag::description[]
Since Asciidoctor counts all images and tables only within each page, their caption numbers start at 1 on every new Antora page by default.
In case of standards, these numbers must be sequential (and unique) within each standard, not each page.

[NOTE]
======
Due to the similarity in its topics, the Asciidoctor extension is also responsible for xref:extensions/pipeline-sequential_sectnums.adoc[sequential section numbers and page titles].

//tag::how[]
The ASAM Antora extension, in combination with the sectnumsoffset_antora extension for Asciidoctor, creates sequential figure and table numbers in Antora. +
To use this feature, add `numbered_titles: true` to the Antora extension configuration.

The extension *only* considers images and tables if they are anchored with the correct anchor type (`[#fig-...]`, `[#tab-...]`).
See the pages on xref:latest@asamprojectguide:compendium:Editorial_guide/09_tables.adoc[] and xref:latest@asamprojectguide:compendium:Editorial_guide/10_figures.adoc[] in the Editorial guide for detailed requirements on each anchor type.

//end::how[]

//tag::prerequisites[]
* All relevant figures must have an xref:latest@asamprojectguide:compendium:Editorial_guide/10_figures.adoc[ASAM-type figure anchor]
* All relevant tables must have an xref:latest@asamprojectguide:compendium:Editorial_guide/09_tables.adoc[ASAM-type table anchor]
* All irrelevant figures and tables must not have a title
* All relevant pages are in the navigation tree
