//tag::description[]
Creates a subsection called "Related Topics" and filles it automatically with cross-references to (other) pages containing the listed keywords.
Works similar to the macro `reference`, but adds said subsection.
//end::description[]

//tag::prerequisites[]
In order to work as intended, you must label all pages you want to automatically cross-reference with the attribute `:keywords:` followed by a comma-separated list of keywords for that page.

Keywords **MUST NOT** start with an exclamation mark!

//tag::how[]
Add `related::<comma-separated-keywords>[]` in an empty line and replace `<comma-separated-keywords>` with a comma-separated list of keywords you want to reference.
You can exclude pages with certain other keywords by negating that keyword.
To negate a keyword, use an exclamation mark (`!`) in front of it.
//end::how[]

//tag::example[]
The following example shows a list of all pages in a new section "Related topics" with the keyword "pipeline" that do not contain the keyword "asciidoctor".
